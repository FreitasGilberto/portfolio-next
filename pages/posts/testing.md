## HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT 

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the three pillars of web development. They are the building blocks of every website and web application.

**HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundation of any website. It provides the structure and content of a web page. HTML is used to define the various elements of a web page such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements on a web page. It provides the designers with the ability to customize the appearance of the web page by defining the layout, color, font, and other visual aspects.

**JavaScript** is a powerful scripting language that adds interactivity and functionality to a web page. It can be used to create dynamic effects, validate forms, display and manipulate data, and much more.

In short, HTML provides the structure, CSS adds style and design, and JavaScript adds interactivity to a web page. Understanding these three technologies is essential for anyone who wants to build a website or a web application.

Stay tuned for more posts on each of these technologies, where we will dive into more details and examples.
